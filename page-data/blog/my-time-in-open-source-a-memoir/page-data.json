Source,</p>\n<p>It's been quite some time since I wrote you.\nFive years or so is my guess.\nLong enough that I'm afraid you've forgotten about me by now.\nYou, on the other hand, are impossible to forget.\nFor many good reasons of course, but also some not so good ones.\nMaking it worse is that you did nothing wrong.\nI figured it was about time I told you about what happened in the odd case you're interested.\nI'll start from the beginning.</p>\n<p>In the mid-to-late aughts I was developing a lot of Flash content for the web.\nIt required quite a bit of coding which I almost always had to teach myself how to do.\nOver time I would be slowly introduced to programming concepts and tools as I engaged with the broader Flash community.\nMost enlightening was learning how to avoid repeating things over and over by using a framework.\nThe first being <a href=\"https://puremvc.org/\">PureMVC</a> for ActionScript.\nI used it a few times but then found <a href=\"https://github.com/robotlegs/robotlegs-framework\">Robot Legs</a>.\nThis would become my preferred framework, probably because I thought the name was cooler.</p>\n<p>Out of curiousity, or maybe just sheer boredome one day, I decided to look at Robot Legs code.\nI didn't go into it thinking I'd learn much.\nIn fact, I was pretty convinced it would be well over my head.\nI was just a self-taught coder with a graphic design degree after all.\nBut to my surprise I was able to grok it without too much trouble.\nThe act of invalidating these assumptions I had made of myself was liberating.\nIt was then that I had fallen head over heels for you.</p>\n<p>My infatuation led me to study <a href=\"https://flex.apache.org/\">Flex</a> and apply what I learned to my own work.\nThere wasn't much in the way of component toolkits or libraries back then.\nSo every new Flash project I started inherited some code I wrote from the last one.\nRefactoring my boilerplate with a bottle (or two) of beer became my favorite past time.\nThe culmination being a <a href=\"https://github.com/mattupstate/AS3-Toolkit\">toolkit</a> I released to your ranks in June 2011.\nReleasing this reminded me of the feeling I'd get after painting graffiti on freight trains.\nThere was no way to know who would see my work but it was now out in the world for all, or no one, to see.\nIt was absolutely exhilarating.</p>\n<p>Why stop there, though?\nNext up was to teach myself Java by studying <a href=\"https://spring.io/\">Spring</a> so I could take on a project at my day job.\nThe task was to improve the frontend and backend of a retail product configuration web app.\nIt would also be my introduction to the cloud having had to use S3 and CloudFront.\nThis would be the most complex thing I would work on in my career by a long shot.\nCompleting the project was a seminal moment for me.\nFrom that point on I no longer identified as a \"Flash Developer\" and it was in some part because of you.</p>\n<p>A little later in 2011 I would gift you two more projects.\n<a href=\"https://github.com/mattupstate/spring-social-foursquare\">Spring Social Foursquare</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/mattupstate/spring-social-instagram\">Spring Social Instagram</a> came from needing to build a few prototypes which used the Foursquare and Instagram APIs.\nThere was nothing special about these projects.\nHowever, I had no idea that anyone would actually use them.\nLet alone be mentioned on the <a href=\"https://projects.spring.io/spring-social/\">Spring Social</a> product page.\nNor had it occurred to me that the Foursquare and Instagram APIs would change and I might be expected to update the code.\nIt hit me real quick that there was a part of our relationship I wasn't prepared for.\nGuilt hit me pretty hard when I imagined how the people who used the code would feel when they'd noticed I hadn't kept pace with the APIs.</p>\n<p>That same year I would also find myself looking for a new job.\nA studio I was fond of for their museum installation work was interested in me but I'd have to know Python.\nSo I taught myself Python using <a href=\"http://learnpythonthehardway.org/\">Learn Python the Hard Way</a> (when it used to be free content) and, perhaps with a bit of luck, landed the job.\nImmediately I started to dig into the Python ecosystem and was blown away by what seemed like an infinite amount projects I could study.\nIt would turn out to be a near perfect activity to distract me from a situation I felt I had lost control of outside of work.\nDopamine is a hell of a drug.</p>\n<p>One of the first projects I discovered would be <a href=\"https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/\">Flask</a>.\nFlask was relatively new at the time and seemed to be gaining popularity as an alternative to Django's \"bloat\".\nThe extension ecosystem, however, was still to be desired.\nIt occurred to me there might be space for something like Spring Security or <a href=\"https://github.com/heartcombo/devise\">Devise</a>.\nSo after a few months of development, in March 2012, I naively gifted you the first versions of <a href=\"https://github.com/mattupstate/flask-security\">Flask-Security</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/mattupstate/flask-social\">Flask-Social</a>.\nI would also adopt a few other Flask extensions as my own.\nSome of which I used in those projects.</p>\n<p>However, just two months before the release, the situation in my life that I alluded to earlier boiled over.\nMy partner moved out after having been married for three years.\nBy most standards the relationship would be described as dysfunctional for the majority of the time we were together.\nOverworking, alcohol and occasional drug use were my preferred coping methods.\nIt's no surprise to me now that in the first two weeks of living alone I experienced my first anxiety attacks.\nOn a few occasions I would spontaneously burst into tears.\nThere were even a few days where I had to call in sick to work for fear of being unable to keep it together.</p>\n<p>The emotions I felt, many I had never experienced before, spooked the hell out of me.\nSo much so that I took myself to see a therapist for the first time in my life.\nTherapy was incredibly helpful and I'm thankful that I found the care I needed.\nIt helped me see the situation for, mostly, what it was.\nOnly mostly because it wasn't until almost a year later that my partner was officially diagnosed with a severe mental health disorder.\nThis helped me understand a lot of the behaviors I had to endure with them.\nMore importantly, from what I can tell, the diagnosis also lead to them receiving the care needed to make major improvements to their life.</p>\n<p>As for me, I finally developed enough self awareness to realize I am a workaholic.\nThat was incredibly hard to come to terms with.\nThe behavior had began well before I met my partner and I had convinced myself that there was no downside to it.\nWorking included my day job but it also included anything related to you.\nYou were predictable, enriching, and supportive of my career.\nI might even say you provided a sense of stability that I wasn't getting elsewhere.\nBut I indulged in you so I could avoid one of the most uncomfortable situations in my life.\nIt's not your fault, though.\nYou were just being you.</p>\n<p>Despite coming to terms with this, and the marriage logically over, it remained difficult to stop overworking.\nFlask-Security would start to develop a community of it's own and I felt compelled to nuture it for the next few years.\nOn the upside, engaging regularly with the NYC Python and Flask communities provided a much needed ego and confidence boost.\nI truly enjoyed meeting new people, expanding my network and making content for meetups.\nHowever, on the downside I would get anxious about the amount of time and energy it would require.\nIt also appeared that the time and energy would only increase the more I would engage.</p>\n<p>As a result my contributions to Flask-Security and the other extensions I maintained would diminish over the next few years.\nI had also found a new rabbit hole to go down when my day job forced me to focus more on operations and cloud resource management.\nThankfully I was lucky enough to fill the gaps with some help from the community.\nNotably, <a href=\"https://www.jonafato.com/\">Jon Banafato</a> and <a href=\"https://jiri.kuncar.dev/\">Jiri Kuncar</a> helped keep the strings mostly tied through 2018.\nI also managed to drastically improve the balance between my work and personal life in part from investing in a new healthy relationship.</p>\n<p>At the same time a <a href=\"https://github.com/Flask-Middleware/flask-security/\">fork</a> had managed to pick up steam.\nIt took me by surprise and my ego took a shot.\nI was also disappointed in myself for not helping usher the project into someone elses hands.\nHamstrung by guilt and feeling burnt out I would lose all interest in the project.\nOver time, however, it occured to me that the license I chose afforded the project to continue without my involvement.\nThis is, after all, what you stand for.\nFree as in libre.\nAm I right?</p>\n<p>It was about April 2016 when I last touched Flask-Security.\nThat was around the time I took a job as a \"DevOps Engineer\" (who says that nowadays anyway?) at a health tech startup.\nFast forward to today and I'm a Director of Engineering at that same company.\nI'm also lucky to have turned the healthy relationship I mentioned earlier into a family with two beautiful kids.\nThis is to say that it's near impossible to find time for you anymore.\nIt's frustrating because I have always enjoyed helping other people make stuff.\nTo be honest, I miss the living hell out of you.</p>\n<p>Who knows, though.\nMy career has never been a straight line.\nMaybe I'll be lucky enough to land a job where where we can go steady again.\nWould you have me back?\nWould you welcome me with open arms?\nWhy am I even asking you that question?\nI guess that's more of a question for me.\nIsn't it?</p>\n<p>Yours truly,<br/>\nMatt</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"December 15, 2021","slug":"/blog/my-time-in-open-source-a-memoir","title":"My Time in Open Source, A
